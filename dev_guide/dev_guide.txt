Purpose
These guidelines ensure clean, consistent, and reviewable development for MaskBar.pk by Mehroob.
The goal is to maintain smooth collaboration, modular structure, and fast iteration while keeping the brand identity consistent across all pages and components.

1. Variable & Naming Conventions
Why: Consistent naming makes code easier to read, scale, and debug.
Rules:
Use camelCase for variables, functions, and component names (e.g. heroSection, productCard).
Use PascalCase for React/Next components (e.g. HeroBanner, FooterMenu).
Use kebab-case for CSS class names (e.g. .hero-section, .product-grid).
File names should match component names exactly (e.g. HeroBanner.jsx, HeroBanner.css).
Use clear and descriptive names — avoid short or generic terms like box, temp, data1.
✅ Good example:
import ProductCard from "@/components/products/ProductCard";
❌ Bad example:
import Box from "@/components/temp/test";

🚀 2. One Task at a Time
Why: To keep code clean and easily reviewable.
Process:
Focus on one task per iteration.
Example: first build HTML structure, then CSS styling, then functionality / API routes.
Never jump between unrelated tasks in one commit or one request.
Each step should end in a review checkpoint.
✅ Example workflow:
Build static structure (HTML + placeholders).
Style using global CSS variables.
Add interactivity (JS logic or React props).
Connect API / backend if required.

🧩 3. Component-Based Development
Why: Encourages modular, reusable, and testable design.
Process:
Each page (e.g. Home, About, Product) is composed of multiple small components (e.g. HeroSection, ProductGrid, NewsletterBanner).
When a component like HeroSection needs 3 sub-components (e.g. HeroText, HeroImage, HeroButton):
Develop one sub-component at a time.
Wait for review and approval before moving to the next.
Each component must be self-contained (CSS + JS + logic inside its folder).

🧱 4. Component Review System
Why: To ensure each piece meets quality and design expectations before going live.
There is a Components Preview Page (/samples/components)
→ Every newly developed component will be added here for visual review.
Each component must include its name, description, and usage example on the sample page.
Once approved, it can be integrated into a live page.

🎨 5. Always Use Global CSS Variables
Why: Ensures visual consistency and makes global theme changes instant.
Never hardcode colors, font sizes, or spacing directly inside components.
Always use values from globals.css.

6. Make Sure to look for components First, If the required component is Available use it, and if not only then start the component development process
