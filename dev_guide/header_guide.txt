The header is the first impression of my brand, so it should feel clean, modern, premium, and convert-oriented (guides users to shop).
Below is a full breakdown of what should be in your header, depending on your goals — and then I’ll show recommended structure (for both desktop and mobile).

🧭 1. Branding Section (Left side)
Purpose: Instantly establish trust + brand recall.
Include:
Logo: “Maskbar by Mehroob”
→ Should be minimal and clean, possibly with an icon or symbol (e.g. drop, mask outline, flower).
Clickable to Home page
✅ Example:
Maskbar by Mehroob

🛍️ 2. Navigation Menu (Center)
Purpose: Let users quickly explore.
Recommended links:
-> Home
-> Shop → Dropdown with categories:
Hydrating Masks
Brightening Masks
Anti-Aging
K-Beauty
All Sheet Masks
-> Best Sellers
-> New Arrivals
-> Explore
-> About
-> Search Bar (Icon)
✅ Example:
Home | Shop ▼ | Best Sellers | Explore ▼ | About


❤️ 3. Utility Icons (Right side)
Purpose: Quick actions — these are essential for ecommerce.
Include:
🧺 Cart Icon
👤 Account / Login Icon → Dropdown for Login/ signup if not Autheticated else Order, Profile, etc
✅ Example:
[🛒2] [👤]


📱 6. Mobile Header Design
Simplify layout:
Left: Hamburger Menu
Center: Logo
Right: Cart + Account icon
Expand menu drawer with links and search inside.
✅ Example:
☰   MaskBar   🛒


Note -> Make sure we take the name of the Webpage like MaskBar from .env file so We after development I decide to chnge name, I just need to change env
